      # packages include .mts/.cts files that Gatsby's query extractor tries to parse
      # and fails on in the CI environment. This is a temporary workaround. If you
      # want the example built in CI again, consider one of the long-term fixes
      # documented in the repo: pin problematic transitive dependencies, use
      # npm/yarn resolutions/overrides, or use a plugin to transpile those modules.
