- Fix ENOENT in onPostBuild when installed via pnpm or using a local `file:..` dependency: plugin now searches both `templates/sitemap.xsl` and `src/templates/sitemap.xsl` and copies the available template into the site's `public/` directory. This prevents build failures in environments where the package layout differs (pnpm, local installs).
